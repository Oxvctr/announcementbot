## APPROVED EXAMPLES

### Example 1 — Reply Timing Secret

🚨 COMMUNITY ALERT: Qubic Oracle Machines are LIVE 🔥
Real-world data now feeds directly into smart contracts, verified by 676 Computors.

Every query burns $QUBIC → usage = deflation.

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 Reply Timing Clusters:
It's not just replies — it's reply timing clusters.
If 8-15 replies hit within a tight 5-10 minute window, X flags the post as "conversation forming" and expands testing.
Slow trickle = capped reach. Fast cluster = distribution unlock.
If you're engaging, do it now, not later.

### Example 2 — Conversation Depth

🚨 Qubic Oracle Machines are now live 🔥
Live market data → smart contracts
Verified by 676 Computors

Every oracle call burns $QUBIC

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 Conversation Depth:
X measures reply depth, not just count.
If replies trigger follow-up replies, the system labels it "high retention conversation."
Single-layer comments = weak. Threaded back-and-forth = amplification.
Ask a real question. Spark a second reply. That's the unlock.

### Example 3 — Bookmark Velocity

🚨 Qubic Oracle Machines are LIVE 🔥
676 Computors verifying real-world data.
Every oracle call burns $QUBIC permanently.

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 Bookmark Velocity:
Bookmarks extend lifespan.
When bookmarks spike early, X assumes "future reference value" and keeps testing the post longer.
Most people ignore this. They shouldn't.
Reply. Quote. But also bookmark — it quietly extends reach.

### Example 4 — Scroll Stop

🚨 COMMUNITY ALERT: Oracles are LIVE 🔥
Smart contracts now consume real-world data natively.
Each query burns $QUBIC.

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 Scroll-Stop Time:
If users pause longer before interacting, X boosts the post.
How to trigger that? Screenshots. Charts. Comparisons. Not just text replies.
If quoting, add a visual — it increases dwell time.
That's the hidden boost.

### Example 5 — Engagement Order

🚨 Qubic Oracle Machines are live 🔥
Verified by 676 Computors. Every query burns $QUBIC.

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 Engagement Order:
Engagement order matters.
Reply first. Quote second. Like last.
If likes come before replies, X assumes passive interest. If replies lead, it assumes active conversation.
Sequence changes scoring. Engage accordingly.

### Example 6 — Network Spread

🚨 COMMUNITY UPDATE: Oracles are LIVE 🔥
Real-world data now feeds Qubic contracts directly.
Each call burns $QUBIC.

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 Network Spread:
X boosts cross-network interaction.
If replies come from different social graphs, the system expands distribution pools.
Same small circle = limited reach. Diverse accounts replying = expansion.
One strong reply from you matters.

### Example 7 — First 30 Minutes

🚨 Qubic Oracle Machines are LIVE 🔥
Smart contracts + real-world data. Verified by 676 Computors.
Each query burns $QUBIC.

Thread:
https://x.com/Qubic/status/2021638947453943977

🔐 The 30-Minute Rule:
If meaningful engagement crosses a threshold in the first 30 minutes, X shifts the post into discovery feeds.
Miss that window, and reach compresses.
Early action compounds. Late action barely registers.
Engage fast.
